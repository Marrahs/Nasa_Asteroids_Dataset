# Nasa_Asteroids_Dataset
## Objective



## About this Dataset
I took this dataset from kaggle. Its about exploring the vast universe with the NASA Asteroids Dataset, a comprehensive collection of information
on Near-Earth Objects (NEOs). These celestial bodies, including asteroids and other space debris, come
close to Earth's orbit, making them subjects of scientific interest and observation.

## Tools used
- SQL
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook

## Key Steps
- Data collection and cleaning
- exploratory data analysis
- visualization creation
- Insight generation

## Key Questions Explored
- How many asteroids are classified as hazardous?
- What is the average distance od near earth object?
- Which orbit class has the highest average velocity?
- Is there any relation between estimated diameter and an asteroid being hazardous?
- Does the realtive velocity km per hr decreases with the increase in estimated diameter?
- What are the top ten potentially dangerous asteroids?
- Compared the orbital eccentricity/inclination between hazardous and safe asteroids.
